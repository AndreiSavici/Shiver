Future plans
============

* Transform some of the scripts to Mantid algorithms
* Create/employ correction functions that work on the MDEvent workspaces: absorption correction, magnetic form factor, polarizer transmission
* Develop a graphical user interface
* Generate background from regions of the data, as described in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.9.011035)
